			<h3>
				<a id="whatIsStjs">What is ST-JS</a>
			</h3>
			<p>ST-JS is a Java-to-JavaScript transpiler. Its goal is to let
				you write true JavaScript while borrowing the syntax and type
				checking of Java.</p>
			<p>ST-JS lets you write your client-side code in Java, and will
				generate the equivalent JavaScript that can then be executed in a
				browser. It lets you write your Java source in the same way that you
				would usually write the equivalent JavaScript. It lets you use all
				the JavaScript libraries you have grown fond of, without ever
				forcing any other library on you.</p>
			<p>The JavaScript ST-JS generates is not only readable, but also
				immediately recognizable. It strives to keep the generated
				JavaScript code as close as possible to your Java source code, and
				to make it look like you had written the JavaScript yourself by
				hand.</p>
			<p>ST-JS also strives to stay as lightweight and un-intrusive as
				possible. This is why ST-JS does not impose or even suggest the use
				of any particular framework or library, be it server-side or
				client-side.</p>






			<h3>
				<a id="whyStjs">Why ST-JS? (aka: the genesis of ST-JS)</a>
			</h3>
			<p>To better explain how ST-JS is useful and how it differs from
				existing tools, let me start by telling you a story. It's the
				genesis of ST-JS.</p>
			<p>
				Alexandru and Nicolas (see: <a href="team.html">Team</a>) and their
				team were working on a rather large HTML 5 web application. The
				development of this application was started many months ago by
				another team of developers. Both teams were composed mostly of java
				developers, with limited JavaScript experience. Development was going
				well at first, but soon slowed down to a crawl.
			</p>
			<p>When the size of the JavaScript codebase reached approximately
				5'000 lines of JavaSript code, all the developers began complaining
				that their progress was being hindered by JavaScript. The project
				would work perfectly in one browser, and then completely fail to
				start in another due to minor syntax errors. Fixing a bug in one
				corner of the application mysteriously caused two new ones in
				another corner. As a result development continued, but no real
				progress was made on the important stuff: delivering features to
				our customers.</p>
			<p>One day, we improvised a small, informal retrospective. We
				analyzed our problems and dug out the root causes. Here is what we
				found:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For a Java developer, JavaScript is full of small gotchas.
					(Arrays are indexed by String? Trailing commas are bad? On an
					array, for-in produces String indices? What's the difference between
					undefined and null again? for-in on an object also brings
					up methods? etc...) While these gotchas are fairly obvious to any
					experienced JavaScript developer, they are surprising for Java
					devs. As a result they often cause obscure bugs, or different
					behavior on different browsers.</li>
				<li>The project has involved more than 15 people across its
					life, with no less than 5 or 6 active at the same time. This
					obviously means that not everybody was aware of all the
					implementation details of the rest of the application. As a result,
					when developers changed a piece of code, they were never fully
					aware of all the consequences of that change on the whole project.
					For example, a dev might want to change the name of a property. How
					can he know he correctly rename it everywhere in the code
					where this property is used? When he sees a property that looks
					like it needs to be changed, how can he be sure that this property
					really belongs to the correct object? Because of all these troubles,
					developers became afraid of refactoring, and the codebase slowly
					became more and more difficult to work with.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>After exposing these causes, the solution to the problem came
				to Alexandru. We could write a Java to Javascript transpiler!</p>
			<p>This had multiple benefits for us:
			<ul>
				<li>We don't have to deal with most of the idiosyncrasies of
					JavaScript. We just write Java, and the transpiler does the rest</li>
				<li>It is immediately clear which variable/field is of what
					type, even to developers unfamiliar with the existing code</li>
				<li>We can refactor safely because all of the Java IDEs know
					how to do that. And for the cases where the refactoring is more
					complicated and done manually, the Java compiler instantly checks
					the correctness of the code.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<p>Within about a week, all the existing JavaScript code was
				converted to Java code following the ST-JS conventions. Since then,
				the project was able to grow freely and healthily.</p>

			<h3><a id="whyNotGwt">Why not GWT/Dart/TypeScript/CoffeeScript/etc... ?</a></h3>
			<p>Before deciding to write ST-JS, we have listed our needs, and
				studied the existing alternatives. Our needs were:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Static type checking</li>
				<li>Widespread first-class IDE support</li>
				<li>Automatic refactoring tools</li>
				<li>Lightweight, no large runtime dependencies</li>
				<li>Un-intrusive - doesn't force us to use any particular
					framework either client-side or server-side, doesn't make it
					inconvenient to use our favorite client-side or server-side
					libraries</li>
				<li>Easy to debug in all environments (dev, test,
					pre-production, production)</li>
				<li>Static code analysis tools are available</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Out of all the existing solutions, none matches all of these
				criteria. ST-JS is our answer to this problem, and it does fulfill
				all of our needs.</p>
			<p>There is another extra benefit that wasn't part of our
				original requirements. If for some reason, in the middle of your
				development process you discovered that ST-JS doesn't work for you,
				you can safely dump your Java source files and continue your
				development in JavaScript directly, by basing it on the generated
				JavaScript.</p>





			<h3><a id="howDoesItWork">How does it work?</a></h3>
			ST-JS is made of multiple components that each have a specific purpose
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>generator:</strong> The main tool of ST-JS. It is the program that translates your Java to JavaScript.
					In order to run correctly, this generator needs both your Java source code and the corresponding
					compiled .class files.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>js-lib:</strong> A small Java library that contains the various classes and interfaces required to write
					ST-JS code that will run your browser. The classes it contains mirror the JavaScript DOM API, as well as many
					other useful JavaScript constructs (Math, XMLHttpRequest, Window, Console, etc...). This library is only used at
					compile time by the Java compiler (or your IDE), to verify that all the calls to the aforementionned JS APIs use
					correct argument types. It is also used by your IDE to provide you with nice, typed, autocomplete while you write
					your ST-Js code.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>stjs.js:</strong> A small JavaScript file that contains the objects and functions necessary to implement
					some of the Java concepts in JavaScript (inheritance, enums, etc...). This file must be included in your final
					HTML page, before all the generated JavaScript. This file is the only mandatory runtime dependency for ST-JS.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>jquery bridge:</strong> A Java library that exposes a properly typed version of the jQuery API. Its purpose
					and usage are similar to js-lib, but for jQuery. Note that jQuery is not a dependency of ST-JS, and using this bridge is
					not mandatory.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Maven plugin:</strong> Helps you setup the generator to run in your Maven projects. If you use Eclipse, this
					plugin also provides some level of integration with Eclipse by showing ST-JS errors as error badges in your Java
					files.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>JUnit runner:</strong> Allows you to write Java unit tests with ST-JS and run them as JavaScript with JUnit.
					You write your unit tests in Java, those tests are translated to JavaScript by the generator, and then sent to a JS
					execution environment. You can decide to run those JS unit tests in many different environments (Rhino, web browser,
					phantomjs, etc...).
				</li>
			</ul>





			<h3><a id="shouldIUseIt">Should I use it?</a></h3>
			<p>As for many other tools, the answer is: "It depends".</p>
			<p>The benefits of ST-JS are most useful if your project matches one or more of the following criteria</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lots of JavaScript (several thousands lines)</li>
				<li>Multiple developers</li>
				<li>Long project history</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Of course, you can use ST-JS for any project, but there is a slight overhead in development due to the
			fact that you have to run the ST-JS generator on your Java code everytime you change it. ST-JS comes with
			a few integrated mechanisms to do it automatically, but at the time of writing it only works properly
			in Eclipse.</p>







			<h3><a id="whatDoesItLookLike">What does it look like?</a></h3>
			<p>Here is an example of a code written in Java and the
				corresponding generated JavaScript. The Java code may seem a bit
				longer and possibly more complicated at a first glance, but it
				provides you with all the advantages of a typed language, while
				preserving as much as possible the resemblance to the JavaScript
				style of programming. The visual resemblance is crucial here since
				it allows for faster learning and easier transition. This visual
				resemblance maintained throughout the library design</p>

			<h4>Short example</h4>

			<div class="grid_5 alpha">
<pre class="code prettyprint lang-java">
// Java

$("#form").submit((ev, THIS) -> {
  StockData stockData =
      that.updateStock($("#newStock").val());
  $(that.row(stockData)).appendTo("table tbody");
  that.stocks.push(stockData.stock);
});
</pre>
			</div>

			<div class="grid_5 omega">
<pre class="code prettyprint lang-JavaScript">
// Generated JavaScript

$("#form").submit(function(ev) {
  var stockData =
      that.updateStock($("#newStock").val());
  $(that.row(stockData)).appendTo("table tbody");
  that.stocks.push(stockData.stock);
});
</pre>
			</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>




			<h4>Some more JavaScript constructs</h4>
			<p>The problem with having JavaScript code generated from Java is
				that Java is less rich than JavaScript. There are JavaScript
				constructions that do not have their corresponding in Java (or they
				are different) like object (map) constructors, array constructors,
				inline functions. We tried to provide constructions that may look
				unusual for a Java developer but somehow familiar to a JavaScript
				developer.</p>

			<h5>Data Objects</h5>
			<p>Javascript has a very handy syntax for creating objects with
				all of their properties already initialized. As you probably know,
				this syntax is the basis of the JSON format.</p>
			<p>ST-JS promotes the usage of a similar syntax in Java, but
				using proper type declarations.</p>
			<div class="grid_5 alpha">
<pre class="code prettyprint lang-java">
// Java

StockData stock = new StockData() { {
    last = 10.0;
    close = 2.0;
    stock = "ABC";
} };</pre>
		</div>

		<div class="grid_5 omega">
<pre class="code prettyprint lang-JavaScript">
// Generated JavaScript

var stock = {
	"last" : 10,
	"close" : 2,
	"stock" : "ABC"
};
</pre>
			</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>


			<h5>Hashes / Associative arrays / Maps</h5>
			<p>In JavaScript, every object can also be used as an associative
				array with string keys. This allows each field of an object to be
				accessed directly via its name.
			<p>
			<p>
				ST-JS provides a bridge class that allows you to use this behavior
				in your Java code, and see it the proper associative array construct
				being used in the translated JavaScript. This capability is provided
				via the <strong>org.stjs.JavaScript.Map</strong> class
			</p>


			<div class="grid_5 alpha">
<pre class="code prettyprint lang-java">
// Java

// This Map is a org.stjs.JavaScript.Map
Map&lt;String, Object&gt; stock = $map(
    "last", 2.0,
    "close", 3.5,
    "symbol", "ABC"
);

Double close = map.$get("close");
stock.$set("close", 4.8);
stock.$delete("close");</pre>
			</div>

			<div class="grid_5 omega">
<pre class="code prettyprint lang-JavaScript">
// Generated JavaScript


var stock = {
    "last" : 2.0,
    "close" : 3.5,
    "symbol" : "ABC";
};

var close = stock["close"];
stock["close"] = 4.8;
delete stock["close"];</pre>
			</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>

			<h5>Arrays</h5>
			<p>
				JavaScript arrays behave like a mixture of a Java's lists and
				arrays. ST-JS provides the <strong>org.stjs.JavaScript.Array</strong>
				class to bring the JavaScript behavior in Java. This class offers
				the same methods as its JavaScript counterpart. Givent that the
				bracket ([]) construct can only be used in Java with a regular
				array, this class provides $get/$set methods that will generate the
				expected code in JavaScript
			</p>

			<div class="grid_5 alpha">
<pre class="code prettyprint lang-java">
// Java

Array&lt;Integer&gt; array = $array(1, 5, 10);
Integer value = array.$get(2);
array.$set(2, 4);

// looping by counter
for(int i = 0; i &lt; array.$length(); i ++){
    console.info(i + " : " + array.$get(i));
}

// looping with forEach
array.forEach((el, i, arr) ->
	console.info(i + " : " + arr.$get(i))
);
</pre>
		</div>

			<div class="grid_5 omega">
<pre class="code prettyprint lang-JavaScript">
// Generated Javascript

var array = [1, 5, 10];
var value = array[2];
array[2] = 4;

// looping by counter
for(var i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i ++){
    console.info(i + " : " + array[i]);
}

// looping with forEach
array.forEach(function(el, i, arr){
    console.info(i + " : " + arr[i]);
}
</pre>
			</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>

			<h5>Inheritance</h5>
			<p>Class inheritance is a fundamental concept in Class-based,
				Object-Oriented languages like Java. That concept doesn't exist in
				JavaScript, but its behavior can be reproduced in its native
				prototype-based inheritance.</p>
			<p>In order to keep the generated JavaScript code as close as
				possible to the source Java code, we have decided not to enforce the
				(in-)visibility of members in JavaScript. This means that when a
				field is marked privat, protected or package-protected in the Java
				source, it will be generated as if it was public in the generated
				JavaScript. This is an acceptable compromise given that the
				visibility restrictions are enforced by the Java compiler before the
				JavaScript code is generated.</p>

			<div class="grid_5 alpha">
<pre class="code prettyprint lang-java">
// Java

public class Child extends Parent {
    public Child(String name) {
        super(name);
        this.name = name;
    }



    public static int staticField = 1;
    public int instanceField = 2;
    public String name = "default";

    @Override
    public void instanceMethod(String n) {
        super.instanceMethod(n + "-");
    }

    public static void staticMethod() {
        staticField += 1;
    }
}</pre>
			</div>
			<div class="grid_5 omega">
<pre class="code prettyprint lang-JavaScript">
// Generated JavaScript


Child = function(name) {
   this._super(null, test);
   this.name = name;
}

stjs.extend(Child, Parent, [],
        function(constructor, prototype){
    constructor.staticField = 1;
    prototype.instanceField = 2;
    prototype.name = "default";


    prototype.instanceMethod = function(n) {
        this._super("instanceMethod", n + "-");
    }

    constructor.staticMethod = function() {
        Child.staticField += 1;
    }
});</pre>
			</div>
			<div class="clear"></div>

			<h5>Comparison</h5>
			<p>
				The comparison of objects or primitives is slightly different
				between Java and Javascript. For example <i>equals</i> method does
				not exist in JavaScript (and there is no way to influence how
				egality operators behave in JavaScript).<br /> Conversely the
				triple "=" (===) does not exist in Java. And the "==" sign has a
				slightly different meaning: in JavaScript it may be accompanied by a
				type conversion!<br /> To have a predictable behavior of the
				generated JavaScript, the <i>equals</i> method is generated as-is.
				The equals method was added to all primitive types wrappers in
				JavaScript. More all generated classes will have an equals method
				defined in their hierarchy. The "==" sign is left untouched as there
				is basically no automatic type conversion involved (because the
				initial Java code wouldn't allow it).
			</p>




			<h3><a id="limitations">Limitations, aka: "What you cannot do in ST-JS?"</a></h3>
			<p>Due to the fact that ST-JS strives to keep the generated
				JavaScript code as close as possible to your source Java code, it
				has to deal with the limitations of both Java and JavaScript. This
				means that some of the features of the Java language cannot be used
				in your ST-JS code, and will cause an error during the
				Java->JavaScript transpilation.</p>

			<p>Here are the main restrictions imposed by ST-JS</p>

			<p>
				<strong>No overloading.</strong> This means you cannot have multiple
				methods with the same name (or multiple constructors) in the same
				class. Method overriding however is allowed, so you can easily
				change the behavior of a method in a subclass.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>No separate namespace for fields and methods.</strong> As a
				result, you cannot have a method and a field with the same name
				within one class and all of its parent classes and interfaces!
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Javascript keywords cannot be used as identifiers.</strong>
				So you cannot use JavaScript keywords or reserved words (such as
				"function", "prototype", "var", etc...) as field, method or class
				name.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Limited support for varargs.</strong>. Varags are only
				allowed if your method has a single argument, and this argument's
				name is "arguments".
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Instance fields can only be initialized at
					declaration with literals.</strong> Therefore any instance field that is
				not a primitive type, a Number, a String or null must be initialized
				in the constructor.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>No native Java arrays.</strong>. Native Java arrays (such as
				String[]) cannot be used as they are not direclty compatible with
				the JavaScript version of arrays. JavaScript arrays are much richer
				than Java arrays, and provide a set of useful methods such as push,
				slice, etc... On top of that, the for-in iteration in Java array is
				done on values (<i>for(String s : array)</i>) while the iteration in
				JavaScript is done on indexes (<i>for(var idx : array)</i>). ST-JS
				provides the <strong>org.stjs.JavaScript.Array</strong> class to
				reproduced the JavaScript array behavior.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>No Java collections.</strong> Since JavaScript doesn't have an
				equivalent to the java.util Collection interfaces and all of its various
				implementations, they cannot be used in your ST-JS code. We have decided
				against supporting these collections directly, because they are a very
				typical Java idiosyncrasy. Using them in some JavaScript code would be
				awkward and doesn't fit the philosophy of ST-JS.
			</p>

			<p>While some of these limitations could be worked around by
				making STJS a little bit more complex, it would result in the
				JavaScript code diverging too far from the original Java source.
				Removing these limitations would need going against to the
				philosophy of ST-JS: the generated JavaScript code is immediately
				recognizable when compared with your Java source code. That's why we
				prefer to produce transpilation-time errors and to ask the user to
				find a suitable alternative.</p>
			</p>
